Performance of the minkit package
=================================

The performance of the package has been measured taking the implementation of the `RooFit <https://root.cern.ch/roofit>`__ as a reference in order to evaluate the timing.
The tests have been run using all the different backends available with `minkit <https://mramospe.github.io/minkit>`__, and compared together.
It has been tested both the generation of random numbers and the minimization procedure for two different models with different complexity.
The first model is composed by a simple Gaussian function, whilst the second is the addition of a Gaussian and an exponential PDFs.
The results can be seen in the following figures:

As it can be seen, the CPU implementations are slower than the GPU for a large number of entries.
For a small number of entries, the timing remains around the same order of magnitude.
Note that the CPU version is very close to that of `RooFit <https://root.cern.ch/roofit>`__, despite the latter is purely implemented in C++.
For minimization, it can be seen that the differences are huge.
For a big number of entries one can find two orders of magnitude of difference between the CPU and GPU implementations.
